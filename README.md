sudo hostnamectl set-hostname k8s-control-plane
```

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname k8s-worker-1
```

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname k8s-worker-2
```

## Update host file

~$ sudo vim /etc/hosts
```

```bash
<ip address> k8s-control-plane
<ip address> k8s-worker-1
<ip address> k8s-worker-2
```

## Install containerd in each node

Do this is each node.

Create a file containerd.conf in /etc/modules-load.d/ so that the **modules are loaded on boot**.

> **Note:** The modules added to the /etc/modules-load/ location are loaded on system boot.

```bash
vim /etc/modules-load.d/containerd.conf
```

~$ sudo modprobe br_netfilter
```

Add the following network settings to **/etc/sysctl.d/99-kubernetes-cri.conf**.

> **Note:** The configurations that are added to sysctl.d are loaded on boot.

````bash

```bash
cloud_user@k8s-control:~$ cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-kubernetes-cri.conf
> net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables
> net.ipv4.ip_forward
> net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ipotables = 1
> EOF
````

Run the following command to load the new settings immediately.
